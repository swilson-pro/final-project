        <h2>Language Skills</h2>
            <p>I have working proficiency in Spanish and Portuguese. These skills have been developed by both formal and informal education, and have been put to the test in high pressure work situations with Wall Street institutions. </p>
        <h2>Photo/Video</h2>
            <p>As a video and photo professional, I have covered several high profile events, utilizing 3-4 cameras simultaneously to provide top quality video to artists and other customers. Recently, I have taken a break from this to focus on developing further as a software engineer. </p>
        <h2>Business Development</h2>
            <p>I will link my resume here. During university I worked in banking during the summers which prepared me for my first job after graduating, as a member of the 2012 Bloomberg Analytics program. Here, I was given intense training in how the finanial services sector works, and expertise in the top software for the financial services, the Bloomberg Terminal. I then rose to the top of the department, before being promoted to the product development team for the portfolio and risk department. During my time at Bloomberg I worked with some of the brightest finance professionals and software engineers in the world. This exposure in particular has prepared me for my work as a software engineer. I have developed skills that have helped transform businesses. </p>
        <h2>Coding</h2>
            <p>I'm currently enrolled in the Flatiron School's Software Engineering Bootcamp, starting on June 27, 2022. In preparation for this bootcamp, I have studied CSS, Javascript, HTML, and other tools. The final prework project is the creation of this website. Before entering the Flatiron School software engineering program, I had strong technical skills in front-end software solutions, particularly for the financial services sector. My time at Bloomberg as a cross-asset Advanced Specialist gave me great exposure to the workflow of programmers, and primed my mind for what is to come as I develop my programming skills. </p>
        <h2>Travel</h2>
            <p>Traveling is one of my favorite past times, and being a software engineer helps me to continue to live a nomading lifestyle because of my ability to get work done from my laptop. </p>
        <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>I graduated with a 3.8 GPA from SUNY Geneseo, majoring in International Relations with a focus on Economics. My minor was in Spanish Language and Literature, and I am a member of Pi Beta Kappa. In my university studies my ability to write and research gained strength, and prepared me for all of the challenges that lay ahead. </p>
